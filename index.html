    <p>Its has been exactly 5 days since I started coding. I am quite impressed with the progress so far. I trust that with time I will develop to become an amazing developer. My portfolio is not quite impressive yet as I am still learning the basics, in time, I am certain I will have a jaw dropping collection. Nevertheless, here is a list of the projects I have been doing for the last 5 days, its basically comprised of my trial projects that i saved while i was trying to learn a new concept from the canvas</p>
